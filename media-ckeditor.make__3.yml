# This is a recipe for Media, Ckeditor, and Media Ckeditor.
# Download this recipe with this drush command:
# drush make /path/to/this/file --no-core /path/to/destination/folder
#
# After downloading and moving files into place, here are the manual steps
# needed to set everything up:
#
# 1. Enable the Media Ckeditor (media_ckeditor) module. It's dependencies will
#    be enabled at the same time.

# 2. At /admin/config/content/ckeditor/editg change the value for
#    "Path to the CKEditor plugins directory" to: %l/ckeditor/plugins

# 3. Configure a text format so that this checkbox is checked:
#    - "Convert Media tags to markup"

# 4. Configure the Ckeditor configuration for that text format so that these
#    checkboxes are checked under the "Editor Appearance" section:
#    - "Plugin for embedding files using Media CKEditor"
#    - "Plugin file: lineutils"
#    - "Plugin file: widget"

      # Required patches (in my option...).

      # This patch allows the same file entity to be embedded multiple times in
      # the same WYSIWYG and still be separately configurable in each instance.
      # (Without the patch, all embeddings will adopt the same configuration.)
      # @see https://www.drupal.org/node/2308451

      # This patch was needed to get alt and title to correctly be recognized
      # from the fields they are assigned to.

      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/wysiwyg_alt_and_title-2416701-30.patch

      # This patch improves support for more types of fields in the Media popup.
      # Without the patch, only single-value text fields are supported (as far
      # as I know) but with the patch, list fields, term reference fields,
      # entityreference fields, and multi-value fields work.

      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/term_reference_fields-2062365-13.patch

      # This patch encodes field data so that it is valid inside JSON, which is
      # necessary if you put a filtered text field on the file entity that is
      # "overridden in the WYSIWYG". Because these fields contain HTML, it
      # needs to be encoded before going into JSON, or the token will be invalid.

      # Optional patches.

      # This patch is necessary if you have CSS that triggers depending on the
      # view mode of the file entity. Without the patch, file entities will end
      # up with all of the view mode's classes. (because they accumulate).

      # This patch is needed if you want to use a custom field to control the
      # "link text" of embedded documents. Without the patch, a mysterious
      # link_text property gets added to the JSON which hijacks the outputted
      # link when the document is rendered. This patch is not recommended for
      # legacy sites that may have content where users manually edited the
      # "link_text" property directly in the JSON to control the link text.

    patch:

      # Required patches (in my opinion...).

      # This patch is necessary specifically for this recipe, because of the
      # way that we are installing the Widget and Line Utilities CKeditor
      # plugins. See below in the Libraries section. The normal way to install
      # them is to "compile" Ckeditor by downloading it from the Ckeditor site
      # using their "builder" thing. But we are trying to automate, so we are
      # downloading the plugins directly.
      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/media_plugin_is_not-2567275-2.patch

      # This patch is necessary if you are using the latest version of the
      # Ckeditor library. Without the patch, the Media widgets will cease being
      # widgets every time you toggle Source mode, and every time you edit the
      # entity.
      # @see https://www.drupal.org/node/2707177
      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/ckeditor_converting-2707177-2.patch

      # This patch makes the toolbar Media button work with the latest Ckeditor.
      # Without the patch, the toolbar button always tries to insert new Media.
      # With the patch, the toolbar button actually edits the selected Media.
      # @see https://www.drupal.org/node/2710841
      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/the_toolbar_button_does-2710841-8.patch

      # This patch is needed for field data to actually be remembered when the
      # popup is opened.

      # This opens the popup when the item is double-clicked in the WYSIWYG.
      # Not technically necessary, but it's something that users expect.

      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/open_media_popup_on-2713757-2.patch

      # Optional patches.

      # This patch adds an "Insert" button on Media fields that inserts the file
      # into an active WYSIWYG editor. This allows editors to first attach a
      # file to an entity, and then from there, insert it into the Body. It
      # helps editors keep track of the files that are embedded. Not at all
      # required though.

      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/media-insert_widget-2451959-14-FOR_USE_WITH_2710841-8.patch

      # This patch adds an entry to the Ckeditor right-click contextual menu.
      # Not at all required, but a usability feature.

      - https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/add_entry_in_ckeditor_s-2711129-2.patch

      # This patch inserts the fully rendered file entities when editing in the
      # WYSIWYG, which gives editors a better idea of the actual thing they are
      # embedding. This is most needed when you have a lot of fields on the file
      # entities that can be overridden in the WYSIWYG and affect the display of
      # the file, or if changing the view mode of a file has a significant affect
      # on its display. If the above is not a requirement for you, I don't
      # recommend using this patch.
